# NMEA_parser
This software decodes NMEA data and provide time date position information from various GPS and GLONASS messages. This software can be easily expanded to user needs and it is most suitable for embedded systems

This is still in development phase

Current messages supported are
1. GPZDA
2. GLZDA
3. GPGGA
4. GLGGA

It inputs one string of message. Not multiple. This is purposefully done becasue, this will be the case in embedded systems.
